    "## Supervised Learning Part II - PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "The library we've been using on our examples so far, **scikit-learn**, offers many options of \"canned\" Machine Learning models via an interface where different algorithms can be manipulated as simple objects. It is a great way to get started with Machine Learning and even solve real-life problems using simple to moderately complex models, with moderately large amounts of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to tackle more data-intensive tasks you need more powerful tools and **scikit-learn's** canned models won't be enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **PyTorch** comes in. It has many performance advantages over **scikit-learn**, including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It supports GPU acceleration whereas sklearn only supports CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It explicitly requires you to define and control the class of functions (we'll call it Models for now on) you'll use to approximate the Target, the loss functions and the optimization solvers as separate objects (some may argue this is an inconvenience). This allows more flexibility to pick the right combination of tools for each type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Its interface for defining Models is more flexible and expressive than sklearn's. This enables you to easily create very complex models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**PyTorch** can be seen as a general purpose Machine Learning, or even Scientific Computing framework. However, here we focus on the most common usage of the library: building Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Neural Networks Primer:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look beyond the cool name, you will see that Neural Networks are just another \"family\" of mathematical function $f(X;\\theta)$. But this family of functions is so useful that it sometimes seems almost magical. To add to their allure, Neural Networks can be difficult to write down mathematically depending on how complex their \"architeture\" is. It is easier to visualize how they work by drawing them as a graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen, writing a Machine Learning algorithm generally involves solving the optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{F(X)} = \\underset{\\theta}{\\operatorname{argmin}} L(Y,f(X;\\theta))$\n",
    "\n",
    "This generally requires finding critical points of a function, that is, points where the derivative of the function is 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you attempt to do it analytically or numerically... How do you compute the derivatives of $L$ when there's a crazy Neural Network nested in it?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Backpropagation\n",
    "\n",
    "For reasons we will not delve into in this workshop, an efficient way of solving the optimization problem above is by combining two numerical algorithms: Backpropagation and variations of Gradient Descent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a summary of the method with vanilla Gradient Descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "###TODO: steps of Backprop and GD\n",
    "\n",

    "To see this in action, let's go back to the Iris Dataset and train a model, this time with **PyTorch**:"
